Today (18 Nov. 2015) I am trying to get LightTable working on my Windows 7 for the Clojure Instarepl. I finally did so (!!!). 
It was by eliminating all embedded blanks from directories in pathnames, which means I had to store the files 
involved in an unusual location. This bug needs a better fix than this, needless to say, even though the thing seems
to be working now.
